<h2>ROMs</h2>
<p>Though root is not required for flashing new ROMs, many apps that make it easier do require root.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.cyanogenmod.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CyanogenMod</a> is a very popular rom that many people put on their phones.  It is also easy to install via the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager"" rel=""noreferrer"">ROM Manager</a> app.  First install the Clockwork recovery.  <strong>Then run a backup before you flash any roms.</strong></p>
<p>Also check out <a href=""/q/17152"">&quot;Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my device&quot;</a> or <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the XDA forums</a> for other custom roms.  Most devices have a specific &quot;Android Development&quot; sub-forum where ROMs are posted.</p>
<p><em>Always do a nandroid backup before installing any rom or mod!</em>  You may also need to wipe all data and cache from your phone before installing or upgrading a ROM.</p>
<strong>Custom Kernels</strong><br><br>
<p>One popular set of kernels is those provided by <a href=""http://chevyno1.richstevenson.com/froyo/kernels/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ChevyNo1</a>. You can also download them via the premium version of the ROM Manager.  <strong>Make a nandroid (ClockworkMod) backup before using these kernels!</strong> You'll also want to get SetCPU to make the most out of these kernels.</p>
<p>Start with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 1.2GHz.  If your phone is stable up to the 1.2GHz range, then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels.  If you start getting force closes, then switch back to a low voltage kernel.</p>
<p>Basically each phone (of the same phone brand/model) varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors. So I may have a Motorola Droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them.  These phones weren't necessarily designed to run like this.</p>

<h2>ROMs</h2>
<p>Though root is not required for flashing new ROMs, many apps that make it easier do require root.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.cyanogenmod.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CyanogenMod</a> is a very popular rom that many people put on their phones.  It is also easy to install via the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager"" rel=""noreferrer"">ROM Manager</a> app.  First install the Clockwork recovery.  <strong>Then run a backup before you flash any roms.</strong></p>
<p>Also check out <a href=""/q/17152"">&quot;Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my device&quot;</a> or <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the XDA forums</a> for other custom roms.  Most devices have a specific &quot;Android Development&quot; sub-forum where ROMs are posted.</p>
<p><em>Always do a nandroid backup before installing any rom or mod!</em>  You may also need to wipe all data and cache from your phone before installing or upgrading a ROM.</p>
<strong>Custom Kernels</strong><br><br>
<p>One popular set of kernels is those provided by <a href=""http://chevyno1.richstevenson.com/froyo/kernels/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ChevyNo1</a>. You can also download them via the premium version of the ROM Manager.  <strong>Make a nandroid (ClockworkMod) backup before using these kernels!</strong> You'll also want to get SetCPU to make the most out of these kernels.</p>
<p>Start with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 1.2GHz.  If your phone is stable up to the 1.2GHz range, then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels.  If you start getting force closes, then switch back to a low voltage kernel.</p>
<p>Basically each phone (of the same phone brand/model) varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors. So I may have a Motorola Droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them.  These phones weren't necessarily designed to run like this.</p>

<h2>ROMs</h2>
<p>Though root is not required for flashing new ROMs, many apps that make it easier do require root.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.cyanogenmod.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CyanogenMod</a> is a very popular rom that many people put on their phones.  It is also easy to install via the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager"" rel=""noreferrer"">ROM Manager</a> app.  First install the Clockwork recovery.  <strong>Then run a backup before you flash any roms.</strong></p>
<p>Also check out <a href=""/q/17152"">&quot;Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my device&quot;</a> or <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the XDA forums</a> for other custom roms.  Most devices have a specific &quot;Android Development&quot; sub-forum where ROMs are posted.</p>
<p><em>Always do a nandroid backup before installing any rom or mod!</em>  You may also need to wipe all data and cache from your phone before installing or upgrading a ROM.</p>
<strong>Custom Kernels</strong><br><br>
<p>One popular set of kernels is those provided by <a href=""http://chevyno1.richstevenson.com/froyo/kernels/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ChevyNo1</a>. You can also download them via the premium version of the ROM Manager.  <strong>Make a nandroid (ClockworkMod) backup before using these kernels!</strong> You'll also want to get SetCPU to make the most out of these kernels.</p>
<p>Start with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 1.2GHz.  If your phone is stable up to the 1.2GHz range, then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels.  If you start getting force closes, then switch back to a low voltage kernel.</p>
<p>Basically each phone (of the same phone brand/model) varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors. So I may have a Motorola Droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them.  These phones weren't necessarily designed to run like this.</p>

If for some reason, a new app version removes key existing functionality, or increases the area an advertisement takes, Titanium Backup allows you to revert to the previous version of that particular application.

<h2>ROMs</h2>
<p>Though root is not required for flashing new ROMs, many apps that make it easier do require root.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.cyanogenmod.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CyanogenMod</a> is a very popular rom that many people put on their phones.  It is also easy to install via the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager"" rel=""noreferrer"">ROM Manager</a> app.  First install the Clockwork recovery.  <strong>Then run a backup before you flash any roms.</strong></p>
<p>Also check out <a href=""/q/17152"">&quot;Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my device&quot;</a> or <a href=""http://forum.xda-developers.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the XDA forums</a> for other custom roms.  Most devices have a specific &quot;Android Development&quot; sub-forum where ROMs are posted.</p>
<p><em>Always do a nandroid backup before installing any rom or mod!</em>  You may also need to wipe all data and cache from your phone before installing or upgrading a ROM.</p>
<strong>Custom Kernels</strong><br><br>
<p>One popular set of kernels is those provided by <a href=""http://chevyno1.richstevenson.com/froyo/kernels/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ChevyNo1</a>. You can also download them via the premium version of the ROM Manager.  <strong>Make a nandroid (ClockworkMod) backup before using these kernels!</strong> You'll also want to get SetCPU to make the most out of these kernels.</p>
<p>Start with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 1.2GHz.  If your phone is stable up to the 1.2GHz range, then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels.  If you start getting force closes, then switch back to a low voltage kernel.</p>
<p>Basically each phone (of the same phone brand/model) varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors. So I may have a Motorola Droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them.  These phones weren't necessarily designed to run like this.</p>

You can also download them via the premium version of the ROM Manager.  <strong>Make a nandroid (ClockworkMod) backup before using these kernels!</strong> You'll also want to get SetCPU to make the most out of these kernels.</p>
<p>Start with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 1.2GHz.  If your phone is stable up to the 1.2GHz range, then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels.  If you start getting force closes, then switch back to a low voltage kernel.</p>
<p>Basically each phone (of the same phone brand/model) varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors. So I may have a Motorola Droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them.  These phones weren't necessarily designed to run like this.</p>
",,240216,"FYI, ES File Explorer is not my go to anymore.  FX file explorer is maintain much more often. Same with Droidwall. AFWall is the new Droidwall.  AFWall is maintain often.  My primary reasons for rooting, have always been for Adaway, AFWall, and FX file explorer. EX Kernel is also great too  Apphider also comes in handy and is not just for those dating apps either. Good for hiding apps (Banking apps) from phone so a guest can use my spare Nexus 5x for casting.",13

<p>With root access you can patch other apps to gain special access to functions, or removal of self-protection for some apps.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://in-appstore.com/android/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Freedom</a> - Get iAP (in-App Purchase) for free! Buy diamonds, rubies and Pro unlocks without real money. Note: Legal restrictions may apply depending on your country/region.</li>

<p>One popular set of kernels is those provided by <a href=""http://chevyno1.richstevenson.com/froyo/kernels/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ChevyNo1</a>. You can also download them via the premium version of the ROM Manager.  <strong>Make a nandroid (ClockworkMod) backup before using these kernels!</strong> You'll also want to get SetCPU to make the most out of these kernels.</p>
<p>Start with the low voltage kernels at the lowest speed and work your way up to the 1.2GHz.  If your phone is stable up to the 1.2GHz range, then try some of the ultra low voltage kernels.  If you start getting force closes, then switch back to a low voltage kernel.</p>
<p>Basically each phone (of the same phone brand/model) varies by which kernel it can handle due to the manufacturing differences between processors. So I may have a Motorola Droid that can run ultra low voltage kernels and yours may not be able to run them.  These phones weren't necessarily designed to run like this.</p>

<h2>Root File Explorers</h2>
<p>You can remount your <code>/system/</code> directory read-write, which will allow you to <a href=""http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Barebones"" rel=""noreferrer"">remove carrier-shipped applications</a> you don't like and so on.  Root file explorers can allow you to view all folders on your phone, such as <code>/data/</code> which is normally protected.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blogspot.superthomaslab.mountsystemrorw"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mount /system RO/RW</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.speedsoftware.rootexplorer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Root Explorer</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop"" rel=""noreferrer"">ES File Explorer</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Patching Apps</h2>
<p>With root access you can patch other apps to gain special access to functions, or removal of self-protection for some apps.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://in-appstore.com/android/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Freedom</a> - Get iAP (in-App Purchase) for free! Buy diamonds, rubies and Pro unlocks without real money. Note: Legal restrictions may apply depending on your country/region.</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.luckypatchers.com/download/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lucky Patcher</a> - Patch apps so that they don't require Google Play Services / displays no more ads / automatically become Pro version / work at certain DPI... There's many you can do with Lucky Patcher and there's even a bunch of patches provided already.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Moving &amp; Removing Apps</h2>
<p>Access to /system also means you can move apps or updates to system apps from /data to /system (with caution!), if the partition has enough space.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup"" rel=""noreferrer"">Titanium Backup</a> - Back up all of your applications and data.  Also allows you to uninstall or freeze system apps, integrate updates into your ROM to save space, move apps to SD, and more.</li>

<li><a href=""http://www.link2sd.info/faq"" rel=""noreferrer"">Link2SD</a> - Move (system) applications to a second partition in SD card, liberating loads of free space in <code>/system</code> partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that moving apps to the sdcard has risks and cons, and should be undertaken only if space is needed. Most modern devices have enough memory for many apps (16GB+), providing that photos/videos/music are stored on an external sdcard.</p>
<h2>Tethering</h2>
<p>Some devices already have Wi-Fi tethering out-of-the-box, like the Samsung Galaxy S, so this isn't such a big deal on them unless the carrier charges for the feature.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cyanogenmod.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">CyanogenMod</a> is a very popular rom that many people put on their phones.  It is also easy to install via the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager"" rel=""noreferrer"">ROM Manager</a> app.  First install the Clockwork recovery.  <strong>Then run a backup before you flash any roms.</strong></p>
